# CSS Slideshow
A lightweight alternative to using the popular bootstrap feature

### Project Goals 
* Make a responsive carousel in Sass
* Reverse engineer Jhey's method into Sass
* Learn about :nth-of-type, ~, and :checked methods of styling

### Project Notes
I really liked [Jhey Tompkins'](https://medium.com/@_jh3y/how-to-pure-css-carousel-ce1a8cb231c8) method of a pure CSS slideshow and I found that 
converting it from his Stylus version into Sass really helped me understand
the underlying principles. I was able to make the slideshow maintain a 
consistent aspect ratio across screen sizes as well, using the [padding-top](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_aspect_ratio.asp) 
method.
If you are looking for a non-bootstrap carousel, this one works really
well, assuming you don't want the auto-scroll feature. Which, personally, I
have never really enjoyed as a user anyway.
